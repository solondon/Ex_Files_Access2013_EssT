I'm Jaryl Leonard, founder and CEO of No Obstacles. As many of you know, No Obstacles donates 10% of our profits every month to a rotating group of charities and foundations that are nominated by the No Obstacles community. In this month's newsletter, I'm excited to announce that we were able to donate over $250,000 to the five charities and environmental groups chosen by you, our customers and supporters. This month's groups are: the Surfrider Foundation, World Wildlife Federation, Greenpeace, Boys & Girls Club of America, and last but not least, the Sierra Club Foundation. We're on track to donate even more next month, so cast your vote for your favorite organization and get involved in the conversation about other ways to help at facebook.com/noobstacles.

Live—and love—boldly!
- Jaryl Leonard
CEO
